# Integrate Facebook login feature with any Android App
This is an Android App, where a user may log in via Facebook. It displays all the details (name, profile picture, email, etc.) on the second page. No backend / server side programming is done. A beautiful and responsive UI has been designed, which works for both mobiles and tablets. The code is extremely clean and easy to understand. This has been done as a part of the Internship Phase 1 Task by The Spark Foundation.
